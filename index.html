        <h2>Intro: </h2>
        <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people,
            in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
            It is a simple game and is often played as a two-player discrete game, but may also be played
            online or played with multiple players simultaneously. It is a popular children's game in many countries with
            many different names.</p>
